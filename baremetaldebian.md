| VMware Nested Virtualization      | Successful. Nested virtualization works in VMware with Windows 10 and 11 VMs. QEMU with Manjaro was installed in a VM. The Vagrant VMware plugin was installed but is not visible in the list, still under investigation. | Debian Bare Metal → VMware Windows10 → QEMU (WHPX) Manjaro | [Vagrant 2.4.5](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) / [vagrant-vmware-desktop (3.0.5, global)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install/vmware) / [VMware Workstation 17.6.1 build-24319023](https://www.fileeagle.com/software/download/20176/209276) | [QEMU 10.0.0 (20250422)](#)     | 28.04.2025   |
| Libvirt QEMU/KVM        | Unsuccessful. The Manjaro installation in the Windows 11 VM within Libvirt was extremely slow, even with the same hardware specs. The installation took 1 day. The Vagrant libvirt plugin works without issue.                                                                                       | Debian Bare Metal → Libvirt Windows11 → QEMU (WHPX) Manjaro | [Vagrant 2.4.5](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) / [vagrant-libvirt (0.12.2, global)](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/installation.html) / [libvirt 9.0.0](https://nsrc.org/workshops/templates-old/brian/foo/ex-debian-kvm-libvirt.md.html#toc3.1)               | [QEMU 10.0.0 (20250422)](#)     | 28.04.2025   |
| Layer 2 Virtualization   | Successful. A Windows 10 VM was installed on Bare Metal Debian with Libvirt QEMU/KVM. A Debian VM was launched within Hyper-V using Vagrant. Performance was good. However, the `kvm-ok` test failed for nested virtualization inside the Debian VM.                                                    | Debian Bare Metal → VMware Windows10 → Hyper-V Debian | [Vagrant 2.4.5](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) / [vagrant-libvirt (0.12.2, global)](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/installation.html) / [libvirt 9.0.0](https://nsrc.org/workshops/templates-old/brian/foo/ex-debian-kvm-libvirt.md.html#toc3.1)            | [QEMU 10.0.0 (20250422)](#)     | 28.04.2025   |
